    <h2>Description</h2>
    Look no further for the ultimate, easy chili recipe. You may think you know how to make chili, but our homemade chili recipe is a gamechanger. With just a push of a button, your weekday dinner is taken care of as the chili cooks away in the slow-cooker. Add chili to your next barbeque to top grilled sausages for an upgraded version of chili dogs. You can easily substitute ground turkey instead of beef for a lighter option and the rest of the ingredients should already be stocked away in your pantry. To top the hot, spicy chili, add shredded Cheddar cheese and corn chips for extra flavor and texture.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef</li>  
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 small green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>2 (16-ounce) cans red kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>2 (14-1/2-ounce) cans diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 to 3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook first 4 ingredients in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring until beef crumbles and is no longer pink; drain. Place mixture in 5-quart slow cooker; stir in beans and remaining ingredients. Cook at HIGH 3 to 4 hours or at LOW 5 to 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Notes: If you want to thicken this saucy chili, stir in finely crushed saltine crackers until the desired thickness is achieved.</li>
    </ol>
